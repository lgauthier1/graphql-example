# Objectives 

This project was developed to learn how to:
- create a simple out-of-the-box sample code to implement a Graphql API with Typescript
- set up a test framework for a Graphql API (Unit & End 2 End test)
- set up Set up code-quality
- set up Set up a robust CICD
- develop a cloud version and on promise version 

This project will be my boiler API template for my next project
